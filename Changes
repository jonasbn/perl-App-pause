        - Forgot to add dependency to LWP::UserAgent and LWP::Protocol::https.


0.21    2015-04-15 (PERLANCAR)

        - First release, split from WWW-PAUSE-Simple to reduce dependencies for
          that distribution. Use fatpacking to reduce dependencies of the script
          to just LWP::UserAgent and LWP::Protocol::https (both involve XS
          modules so they can't be fatpacked).
